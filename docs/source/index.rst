Welcome to sr0wx.py's documentation!
====================================

sr0wx.py is a software to run meteo station on amateur band.

Station can give informations about current meteo conditions, weather
forecast, meteo and hydro awarenesses, and so on. Currently, our only source
of information is Internet, but sr0wx.py can potentially read informations
from any source (see modules page).

sr0wx.py can speak about everything and in any language.
