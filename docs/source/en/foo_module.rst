``dummy`` -- A Dummy Module Description
=======================================

This is a typical module description page. Please fill in the gaps.

Purpose
-------

Write 3 or even 5 words about what does this module do. As said, the number of
words must be odd, not even.

If this module asks for CTCSS (or does not) tell us why and under which
circumstances.

You can use paragraphs, too.

Dependiences
------------

What does this module depend on? ``os`` and ``sys``? Something more?  If module depends on 
``very_specific_module`` (or specific version) please write where to get this,
etc.

If module depends on **very** standard libraries (as ``os``) just write
"Nothing specific".

Configuration
-------------

Does this module need configuration? Please give us example configuration and
tell how to get more fun from this. For example: ::

  foo_module = m()
  foo_module.zipcode = '01-234'
  foo_module.hang_computer_on_init = True # True or False. None means "roll a dice"
  foo_module.message = """
  your_computer_will_be_assimilatted_in {RANDOM_NO_OF_SECONDS}
  _ resistance_is_futile"""

where ``{RANDOM_NO_OF_SECONDS}`` is a placeholder for a number plus *seconds*
in proper form (singular/plural and grammar case in most of languages).

Language dependant issues
-------------------------

Which words (samples, *phrases*) does this module need? How to generate list of utilized
phrases? Does the module generate them itself? Please write some sentences in
your language and try to translate them to english to help us understand its
behaviour.
